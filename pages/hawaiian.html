                <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion in the melted butter until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mustard, poppy seeds, and Worcestershire sauce; cook and stir for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Arrange the roll bottoms in the prepared baking dish. Spoon 2/3 of the onion mixture over top. Add ham and cheese to each roll. Place the roll tops over the cheese layer, then brush the remaining onion mixture over top. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
